Synthetic Biology Reusable Optimization Methodology

### What is SBROME?
SBROME (Synthetic Biology Reusable Optimization Methodology) is a tool to design synthetic gene circuits. An abstract user-defined circuit is first transformed and matched against a module database that incorporates circuits that have previously been experimentally characterized. Then the resulting circuit is decomposed to subcircuits that are populated with the set of parts that best approximate the desired function.
